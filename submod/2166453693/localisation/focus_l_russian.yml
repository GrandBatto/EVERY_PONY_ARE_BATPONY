 continuous_non_factory_construct:0 "Construction Engineering"
 continuous_non_factory_construct_desc:0 "There is still a lot of slack in our construction industry. By focusing our attention on it, we can achieve a significant improvent in construction speed. Unfortunately, the production of machine tools has proven a major bottleneck in the expansion of our heavy industry, so they won't benefit from efforts in this area. "

 SOV_workers_in_the_dissident_republics:0 "Workers in the Dissident Republics"
 SOV_workers_in_the_dissident_republics_desc:0 "Workers of the dissident Soviet Republics have been known to be less loyal to their employers. Perhaps we could reach some kind of agreement with them to increase production in those regions."

 SOV_allies_in_the_republics:0 "Allies in the Republics"
 SOV_allies_in_the_republics_desc:0 "Due to his reformist agenda, Gorbachev has many allies in the dissident republics from the Baltics to Central Asia. These alliances could be utilised to strengthen our position and the stability of our Union."

 SOV_root_out_corruption_desc:0 "Gorbachev promised that corruption within the government would be wiped out in little time after his rise to power. Now is the time to fulfill that promise and rid our great nation of its internal enemies."

 SOV_support_elites_desc:0 "Purging the corrupt elite of the Soviet Union will create a very unstable situation for us. We must not fulfill Gorbachev's original promises, and allow the elites to flourish, as long as they pledge their total support for the Chairman."
 SOV_more_power_to_trade_unions:0 "More Power to Trade Unions"
 SOV_more_power_to_trade_unions_desc:0 "Independent trade unions are still a long way off and perhaps will never come to fruition in the USSR. However, we should give them more power and freedom, rather than being totally controlled by the government."

 SOV_ease_the_cult_of_personality_desc:0 "Every leader since Stalin has established a cult of personality, linking back to the wartime leader as a hero of the Soviet Union.

 SOV_true_reforms:0 "True Reforms"

 SOV_individuality_in_work:0 "Individuality in Work"
 SOV_individuality_in_work_desc:0 "The collectivised Soviet economy has decreased worker participation and motivation, as most are guaranteed employment whether they work hard or not. Now the Soviet people should be rewarded for their labour, as long as they put in the effort required."
 SOV_embrace_the_state:0 "Embrace the State"
 SOV_embrace_the_state_desc:0 "Reforms were necessary in the Soviet Union, but those calling for a new revolution and even the dissolution of the Union are madmen. Gorbachev will embrace the state and all its benefits."
 SOV_gorbachevs_kgb:0 "Gorbachev's KGB"
 SOV_gorbachevs_kgb_desc:0 "The KGB has been a known opponent of Gorbachev, both in his early political days and now as Chairman. However, by sidelining radical reformists and revolutionaries, it is possible that he could restore their trust in the leadership."
 SOV_strengthen_the_warsaw_pact:0 "Strengthen the Warsaw Pact"
 SOV_strengthen_the_warsaw_pact_desc:0 "Member nations of the Warsaw Pact expected support for reform within their borders once Chairman Gorbachev was elected. However, with our great leader embracing the Soviet state, perhaps we could strengthen our allies instead."

 SOV_eurasian_nationalist:0 "Eurasian Nationalist"

 SOV_improve_russian_living_conditions_desc:0 "At its core the Eurasian movement is firmly based in Russia, where it has the most support. We should improve the RSFSR's living conditions to garner support for Rutskoy's vision and to establish a secure society."
 SOV_crackdown_in_the_baltics:0 "Crackdown in the Baltics"
 SOV_crackdown_in_the_baltics_desc:0 "The Baltic Republics are less than joyous upon hearing about Chairman Rutskoy's Eurasian sympathies. Perhaps they need a lesson..."

 SOV_ease_separatist_tensions:0 "Ease Separatist Tensions"

 SOV_closed_society:0 "Closed Society"
 SOV_closed_society_desc:0 "A more open society in recent years has led to destabilisation in the Soviet Union and cultures drifting in from around the world. We should close our great society from outside influences and protect the nation's history."

 SOV_strengthen_the_chairman:0 "Strengthen the Chairman"
 SOV_strengthen_the_chairman_desc:0 "While a strongman, Yazov did hand over some powers to the Politburo and slightly weaken his position. In hindsight this was a terrible move, as now our new Chairman must restore his lost power."
 SOV_economic_recovery_plan:0 "Economic Recovery Plan"
 SOV_economic_recovery_plan_desc:0 "The economic situation in the Soviet Union is a looming disaster that many are unwilling to admit. While recovering from the political fallout from Yazov's assassination, we must not forget that the Soviet economy will collapse if something doesn't happen."

 SOV_end_the_trade_unions_desc:0 "Putin's predecessor allowed some trade unions to flourish, but with almost complete state control. However they have hindered economic growth and influenced the Politburo far too much. The trade unions must end."

 USA_the_industrial_issue_desc:0 "Our economic situation is one of the poorest in the former United States, as the South has never been a major center for industry and development. This issue must be solved as soon as possible if we are to overcome other grievances."
 USA_low_company_tax:0 "Low Company Tax"
 USA_low_company_tax_desc:0 "Lowering taxes on corporations is the way forward. With lower taxes, corporations can pursue economic profits without interference from the state, and the economy can achieve its full potential without regulations from any federal body."
 USA_support_companies:0 "Support Companies"
 USA_support_companies_desc:0 "Corporations need all the support they can get, and what better source of that support than the government? Companies and corporations built old America, and with the collapse of the democratic welfare states of Europe, it is clear that the government must step away as the supreme economic body. Business is business!"
 USA_a_middle_ground:0 "A Middle Ground"
 USA_a_middle_ground_desc:0 "The current tax rate placed on corporations should be enforced. Centrist economics, not radicalism, is the way forward for the American nation, and must be represented in our economy."
 USA_promote_investment:0 "Promote Investment"
 USA_promote_investment_desc:0 "It is critical that our government promote investment both in the stock market and in economic sectors deserving of increased involvement from the federal government. Investing in failing industries will save jobs and keep unemployment low."
 USA_minimise_imports:0 "Minimise Imports"
 USA_minimise_imports_desc:0 "We should be working towards self-sufficiency in many economic sectors, both private and public. The United States of America once stood as one of the world's great global hegemons along with the Soviet Union, and as its natural successor, we should continue self-sufficiency, and build ourselves as a nation worthy of America's name."
 USA_adopt_centrist_economic_policy:0 "Adopt Centrist Economic Policy"
 USA_adopt_centrist_economic_policy_desc:0 "It seems the centrists have the right idea. Perhaps we could apply their economic theories to our next budget. A balance between leftism and rightism must be upheld, and populist economic systems only based on upholding a misguided loyalty to the people's belief are simply foolish. Only a centrist economic system can address the needs of the people."
 USA_high_company_tax:0 "High Company Tax"
 USA_high_company_tax_desc:0 "Raising taxes on corporations is the way forward. If corporations continue to dodge taxes utilizing havens and anti-worker attitudes and programs, our nation's unity and economy will suffer. What we must do is make sure taxes are properly applied to these corporate juggernauts, and raise the rates on the worst of the worst."
 USA_support_workers:0 "Support Workers"
 USA_support_workers_desc:0 "Previous governments have worked too closely with elites. We have to start from the ground up by supporting workers. It is important that the welfare of the general populace be safeguarded over the so-called necessities of rich elites."
 USA_federal_intervention:0 "Federal Intervention"
 USA_federal_intervention_desc:0 "The economy requires direct intervention from the federal government. With our executives leaving the country in droves for other free capitalist nations, it is clear we must supplement their loss with new programs designed to increase federal interference in the economy."
 USA_social_programs_for_laborers:0 "Social Programs for Laborers"
 USA_social_programs_for_laborers_desc:0 "The benefits of increased social programs and welfare simply outweigh the negatives. The American government must help its people so that they can help our government, and together create a relationship that unites both American politicians and the American populace."
 USA_industry_in_georgia:0 "Industry in Georgia"
 USA_industry_in_georgia_desc:0 "Georgia could do with more investment from the government. Agricultural farms, especially those specializing in peanuts, berries, and soybeans, can no longer suit the needs of a growing intelligent labor force in the state, which is why Georgia’s farming technologies must be improved upon."
 USA_industry_in_alabama:0 "Industry in Alabama"
 USA_industry_in_alabama_desc:0 "Alabama could do with more investment from the government. Much of Alabama’s industry has served to fuel large aerospace and military technology companies, but with our military already receiving large-scale government subsidies, the economy of Alabama must be significantly diversified."
 USA_industry_in_carolina:0 "Industry in Carolina"
 USA_industry_in_carolina_desc:0 "North and South Carolina could do with more investment from the government. Many of the manufacturing jobs that once were the lifeblood of Carolina’s industrial scene have now been lost to stable democratic nations across the world. With investment in the region, however, we can make sure we restore American jobs for American workers."
 USA_nationalist_policies:0 "Nationalist Policies"
 USA_nationalist_policies_desc:0 "The re-election of a Republican President has solidified our control over America's political system. We should capitalise on this advantage and push for new policies."
 USA_freedom_act:0 "Freedom Act"
 USA_freedom_act_desc:0 "Your freedom is protected by our surveillance. A new bill known as the "Freedom Act" by the American public shall ensure the personal rights of Americans by monitoring for pro-Soviet or pro-Commonwealth dissidents spouting their authoritarian rhetoric. In this time of national turmoil, America must be protected from traitors."
 USA_establish_new_nsa:0 "Establish New NSA"
 USA_establish_new_nsa_desc:0 "The National Security Agency was unfortunately abolished decades ago, but perhaps it could return with even more powers. With our nation beset by socialism and fascism, both collectivist evils that have attempted to subvert our great nation for decades, it is clear that our people must be monitored by the government so that these ideologies shall never hold relevance in Atlanta."
 USA_work_for_the_nation:0 "Work for the Nation"
 USA_work_for_the_nation_desc:0 "Greediness and welfare have done little to advance the economy into prosperity. Work for the nation, not the individual! New programs across America shall encourage full employment across our country, so that the unemployed do not have to rely on welfare and state expenditures. Americans must work harder instead of sapping the strength of the government!"
 USA_traditional_values:0 "Traditional Values"
 USA_traditional_values_desc:0 "Traditional Christian values should be protected by the federal government. With radical leftists across the world calling for the abolishment of the nuclear family and the destruction of traditional values, it is clear President [Root.GetLeader] must take a stand against modern progressivism and support the values that originally made America great."
 USA_rewrite_textbooks:0 "Rewrite Textbooks"
 USA_rewrite_textbooks_desc:0 "It has come to our attention that the curriculum has still failed to enforce traditional Republican values. Many of the leaders in this country fear that our people will embrace leftism and anti-Americanism due to the biased accounts of American history being taught in our schools. Instead, we must promote traditional American values and history, and remember our glorious past."
 USA_review_the_separation:0 "Review the Separation"
 USA_review_the_separation_desc:0 "Separation of church and state has been a failure. The two institutions should work together and in harmony. Our nation was built by and for Judeo-Christians so that their values of tradition, democracy, and freedom could be upheld. With atheism and alternative religions rising in popularity, our government must cement Christianity in the constitution of the American Republic itself."
 USA_liberty_is_paramount:0 "Liberty is Paramount"
 USA_liberty_is_paramount_desc:0 "The National Security Agency mustn't breach its guidelines regarding surveillance. Although rooting out communists and fascists is necessary for a stable America, the common people should have nothing to fear from their government. President [Root.GetLeader] has made it clear that such programs shall always safeguard the liberty of Americans before anything else."
 USA_secular_america:0 "Secular America"
 USA_secular_america_desc:0 "Some radicals have proposed abolishing the separation of church and state, but this would undermine the core secular values of America. America has never been a Christian nation, and the values of the 1st amendment have safeguarded freedom of worship in this great country for centuries. While we may not bear the name of the United States, we must continue their values."
 USA_one_nation_under_the_flag:0 "One Nation Under the Flag"
 USA_one_nation_under_the_flag_desc:0 "The President has too much control. The founders of the American Republic in 1776 designed our nation's constitution around the principles of checks and balances. A common belief in American nationalism, liberty, and justice should guide us, not a President with a cult of personality surrounding his every move."
 USA_conservative_policies:0 "Conservative Policies"
 USA_conservative_policies_desc:0 "The election of Bentley as President was a stunning upset and wakeup call for the Republicans. We should begin capitalising on this advantage immediately and push for new policies before our opposition can culminate behind a refined nationalist platform."
 USA_end_republican_dominance:0 "End Republican Dominance"
 USA_end_republican_dominance_desc:0 "Now that the people know a non-Republican candidate can seize the Presidency, special elections around the country will surely demolish the Republican Party. The Republican Party's control over the country in the past years has been nothing but authoritarian, and has crippled the democratic institutions that the Founding Fathers created for America."
 USA_end_of_the_personality_cult:0 "End of the Personality Cult"
 USA_end_of_the_personality_cult_desc:0 "A personality cult around George Bush Senior has existed since his arrival in Atlanta, ensuring that the Republicans would always have a firm grip over our country. With Jeb Bush's humiliating defeat in the 2010 elections, it is time to finally nip the cult in the bud, and show the people that Bush Sr. is anything but a humble populist."
 USA_life:0 "Life"
 USA_life_desc:0 "The first value that Thomas Jefferson enshrined in the Declaration of Independence was life. We must remember that no American should ever have their life threatened by the government or by malicious actors without just, legal repercussions for the act and that this right also extends to the unborn."
 USA_liberty:0 "Liberty"
 USA_liberty_desc:0 "The second value that Thomas Jefferson enshrined in the Declaration of Independence was liberty. Before and during Bentley's presidency, the Republicans have proposed sweeping surveillance legislation such as the Freedom Act and the restoration of the National Security Agency. Americans are entitled to liberty from search and seizure under their inalienable rights!"
 USA_pursuit_of_happiness:0 "Pursuit of Happiness"
 USA_pursuit_of_happiness_desc:0 "The third value that Thomas Jefferson enshrined in the Declaration of Independence was the pursuit of happiness. A value that has been forgotten by most socialists, each American should be entitled to economic opportunity through low taxes, low regulations, and low intervention. Property is just as much a right as any other."
 USA_a_proud_army:0 "A Proud Army"
 USA_a_proud_army_desc:0 "All soldiers should be proud to fight for President Bentley. America's military was once a source of pride and awe for the rest of the world, as they looked upon our sheer power as a force in the world. Although we should remain cautious about engaging in interventionism once more, our military must be strengthened and supported."
 USA_lower_taxes:0 "Lower Taxes"
 USA_lower_taxes_desc:0 "Low taxes are a core value of the conservative movement. While Rumsfeld was forced to hike taxes to pay for his costly interventions against communism, we are not in the same situation. The taxes imposed by the Republicans must be slashed so that the American people can continue to seek out opportunity!"
 USA_i_wish_i_was_in_dixie:0 "I Wish I Was In Dixie"
 USA_i_wish_i_was_in_dixie_desc:0 "The Republic's days are numbered. The South will rise again! Although many view the idea of the Confederacy as racist and vile, Davis' confederation of states was the only nation that truly embodied the values of the American south without succumbing to a Northern elite. Southern independence must be restored!"
 USA_begin_decentralisation:0 "Begin Decentralisation"
 USA_begin_decentralisation_desc:0 "Congress must pass amendments gradually decentralising the Republic. The old United States of America abandoned its principles of states' rights a long time ago in favor of centralizing power in the hands of Congress and the Presidency, a mistake that must be rectified."
 USA_weaken_the_president:0 "Weaken the President"
 USA_weaken_the_president_desc:0 "By weakening the President, we will ensure the states have ultimate power within the CSA. During times of national turmoil, the President was given the power to roll back habeas corpus and personal liberty without the approval of even Congress. This must change - the states, legislature, and by extension, the people, must have supreme power in our Republic."
 USA_draft_a_confederate_constitution:0 "Draft a Confederate Constitution"
 USA_draft_a_confederate_constitution_desc:0 "The old American constitution is outdated and irrelevant to the Confederate States. Instead, we should look to the shared heritage and values of the South, and draft a constitution truly befitting of the CSA."
 USA_proclaim_confederate_states:0 "Proclaim the Confederate States"
 USA_proclaim_confederate_states_desc:0 "The time has come! Once again the Confederate States of America will have their independence. With our unique culture, our traditions of liberty and democracy that have been forgotten by the Yankees, and our nationalism toward the Southern ideal, we must exist as an independent nation from the rest of America."
 USA_ensure_state_rights:0 "Ensure State Rights"
 USA_ensure_state_rights_desc:0 "For too long the states have been sidelined by a federal government. Now that we have curtailed the rights of the executive and the legislature, it is time to finally restore rights to the states and local authorities."
 USA_ensure_personal_rights:0 "Ensure Personal Rights"
 USA_ensure_personal_rights_desc:0 "President Bentley's reforms were still too moderate. We must ensure the rights of all Americans in this democracy. In a world where personal liberty has been trampled by authoritarian despots, even in our own continent, the CSA must stand as a beacon of constitutional principles."
 USA_ensure_security:0 "Ensure Security"
 USA_ensure_security_desc:0 "Some civil liberties can be done away with in the name of security and stability. Although we must ensure states' rights and constitutional textualism, our government must have the power to act against the threats that plague any democratic system."
 USA_cut_ties_to_the_usa:0 "Cut Ties to the USA"
 USA_cut_ties_to_the_usa_desc:0 "Our claims to the former United States are hindering efforts to improve relations both in the Americas and around the world. We are not the United States - we are the Confederate States of America, and heirs to the Old South, not some dead Yankee dream."
 USA_dc_for_virginia:0 "DC for Virginia"
 USA_dc_for_virginia_desc:0 "The Socialists want DC, we want Virginia. Perhaps a profitable agreement could be made between our two nations. After all, Virginia has no clear value to the Yankees, and DC would grant them significant legitimacy among the rest of America. The cradle of the South must return to the Confederacy!"
 USA_engage_with_south_america:0 "Engage With South America"
 USA_engage_with_south_america_desc:0 "Establishing stronger ties with South America is an inevitable way forward for the CSA. Although our new CSA has abandoned imperialism and interventionism, we must still stand strong on the world stage, and support Central and South American nations in their fight against Soviet incursion."
 USA_authority_and_strength:0 "Authority and Strength"
 USA_authority_and_strength_desc:0 "David Duke's election proved to the Republican elite that we want a strong leader with an iron fist. America must be strong if it is to survive the coming storm and oppose the communist menace that has taken control over half the nation."
 USA_restore_order:0 "Restore Order"
 USA_restore_order_desc:0 "In an unprecedented political situation, President Duke's party has faced a horrific result in the congressional elections. With chaos in the streets and a government without a mandate, order must be restored."
 USA_continue_military_leadership:0 "Continue Military Leadership"
 USA_continue_military_leadership_desc:0 "The junta will continue to maintain peace and order on our streets. With Congress in complete chaos following the failure of David Duke to establish a secure government and radical terrorist movements becoming more and more prominent, there is no choice but to temporarily suspend American democracy."
 USA_enforce_martial_law:0 "Enforce Martial Law"
 USA_enforce_martial_law_desc:0 "Martial law is necessary to keep the dissidents of our nation in check. Numerous revolutionary and activist organizations seeking only to destabilize the American Republic have come out of the woodwork, and must be taken off the streets if our constitutional principles are to endure."
 USA_secure_the_west:0 "Secure the West"
 USA_secure_the_west_desc:0 "The Western regions are unusually rebellious in this chaotic time. However, with the police and military, we can secure the West. With many pinning the attacks on Texan nationalists and democrats loyal to the Midwest Union and the APC, perhaps a direct military investigation would also suit the situation..."
 USA_establish_secret_police:0 "Establish Secret Police"
 USA_establish_secret_police_desc:0 "A secret police will remove dissidents once and for all. With opposition to the military government continuing to rise, it is necessary for our government to root out any traitors that are still lurking in the government of the American Republic, however high in the ranks they may be."
 USA_conservative_junta:0 "Conservative Junta"
 USA_conservative_junta_desc:0 "Some have suggested we follow in the ideals of democrats and certain leftists while still maintaining military leadership. However, such values will not help us rule with an iron fist. Instead, we must focus on ensuring that capitalism and traditional values are enshrined in our government, just as they were in our old administrations."
 USA_a_new_admiralty:0 "A New Admiralty"
 USA_a_new_admiralty_desc:0 "With the army under our control, the next step is creating a loyal American navy. Although the navy has been largely neglected on account of our government's recent focus on the army as opposed to other branches, it can still become just as strong as the other navies of America, if not stronger."
 USA_corporate_military_government:0 "Corporate Military Government"

 USA_a_legitimate_ruler:0 "A Legitimate Ruler"
 USA_a_legitimate_ruler_desc:0 "The last true President of the people was George Washington. His descendant today, Paul Emery Washington, shall be the first true people's King of America. Although many in our nation will take offence at the idea of an American monarchy, the rule of Paul I will provide stability and justice for all Americans."
 USA_consolidate_our_rule:0 "Consolidate Our Rule"
 USA_consolidate_our_rule_desc:0 "Monarchism is still an American ideology in its infancy. We should be working to consolidate the rule of Paul I. Inviting him to Atlanta to be fully coronated as King of America will allow the sceptical politicians of the South to understand that Paul I embodies the values and spirit of the American nation."
 USA_work_with_congress:0 "Work With Congress"
 USA_work_with_congress_desc:0 "True power in this country still lies with Congress, which is why the King should try to work with them. The great statesmen of George Washington's era understood the value of a legislature to check and challenge the rights of the executive, and we should not forget their teachings on civil government... even if they chose to embrace republicanism."
 USA_bypass_congress:0 "Bypass Congress"
 USA_bypass_congress_desc:0 "Congress is a useless government institution without any real power these days. The King doesn't need to worry about another few hundred people in his government. Paul I can speak for all Americans, unlike the executives and bureaucrats in Atlanta, and needs no guidance from pampered politicians."
 USA_establish_the_council_of_princes:0 "Establish the Council of Princes"
 USA_establish_the_council_of_princes_desc:0 "A pan-American Council of Princes will ensure Midwestern, Texan, Californian and any other Americans are represented in a future united kingdom. Furthermore, it shall allow us to grant the descendants of the founding fathers the positions and powers they are entitled to as descendants of the old American aristocracy."
 USA_fight_stigma:0 "Fight Stigma"
 USA_fight_stigma_desc:0 "In America there is still a lingering stigma concerning monarchism, as it was the ideology Washington himself fought against. However, they simply fail to see the glory it has brought and can bring us. Besides, Alexander Hamilton and his Federalists supported ideas which essentially advocate for an elective monarchy, all of which are embodied in our current government."
 USA_the_kings_army:0 "The King's Army"
 USA_the_kings_army_desc:0 "There shall be no army if it isn't in the King's name! A true Royal American Army will make the communists across the nation fear the might of the King of America, Paul Emery Washingon. By integrating many current military structures, we can even strengthen our old military in the process."
 USA_royal_investment:0 "Royal Investment"
 USA_royal_investment_desc:0 "Official investment from the royal family in both rural and urban industry will strengthen the economy and boost our popularity in certain regions. With so many Americans in poverty under the chaos of the Great Collapse and a lackluster Republican response, it is clear that the monarchy must take up the charge for economic justice."
 USA_end_this_turmoil:0 "End This Turmoil"
 USA_end_this_turmoil_desc:0 "The time has finally come to truly take hold of this country and end the turmoil. With the legacy of President David Duke's brief term and subsequent military takeover in the past, we can finally look to the future of a glorious American monarchy. For Paul I!"
 USA_crush_republicans:0 "Crush Republicans"
 USA_crush_republicans_desc:0 "Republican politicians currently have the most power in our Kingdom, but don't believe in the King's values or government. Although their predecessors once had faith in the American aristocracy, the current conservative movement is only interested in abandoning traditional values and enriching the power of corporations. They must go!"
 USA_befriend_kingdoms:0 "Befriend Kingdoms"
 USA_befriend_kingdoms_desc:0 "All monarchs around the world will soon know the name Paul the First. In time, perhaps we can restore America's position on the world stage, and challenge the supremacy of communists and republicans across the globe."
 USA_ensure_cia_loyalty:0 "Ensure CIA Loyalty"
 USA_ensure_cia_loyalty_desc:0 "The Director of the Central Intelligence Agency must swear absolute allegiance to the King, not his petty Presidents of days past. Although they would never be so silly as to coup their own people, their lack of loyalty and faith in the monarchy is altogether quite disturbing."
 USA_elect_a_pm:0 "Elect a Prime Minister"
 USA_elect_a_pm_desc:0 "Some elements of democracy are necessary, which is why we should hold an election for the first Prime Minister of America. A constitutional monarchy shall revitalize support for Paul I's regime and make it known to all Americans that a benevolent kingdom shall be the future of America for years to come."
 USA_showcase_stability:0 "Showcase Stability"
 USA_showcase_stability_desc:0 "We are finally stable, secure and open to all Americans. Although many originally saw our movement as a fringe, far-right movement that sought to betray the values that made America great, opinion on the monarchy has now changed. Now that democracy reigns once more in America, the world can understand that our regime is stable, and here to stay."
 USA_one_man_one_nation:0 "One Man, One Nation"
 USA_one_man_one_nation_desc:0 "Democracy no longer has any place in our society. There will be no Prime Minister. Democracy brought us the turmoil that destroyed America's superpower status, and democracy brought us the collapse of the United States as communists and liberals continued to erode tradition. Never again shall Americans be subject to the whims of corrupt politicians."
 USA_devotion_to_the_king:0 "Devotion to the King"
 USA_devotion_to_the_king_desc:0 "All citizens of this great nation will devote their working lives to the King. Paul I is the ideal monarch for America, and encapsulates the American Dream. Born from nothing, he was able to rise to the top of American politics, and now, he and his descendants will be honoured as the saviours of a nation many thought would never rise again."
 USA_corporatism:0 "Corporatism"
 USA_corporatism_desc:0 "Corporatism is the way forward. An American corporatocracy will restore control of our nation to those who can truly run it, not weak-willed politicians. Although many in the fascist movement will express anger at Duke from bending to corporate interests, it is clear that an America managed by corporations and businessmen will be more efficient than any democratic regime."
 USA_weaken_democratic_institutions:0 "Weaken Democratic Institutions"
 USA_weaken_democratic_institutions_desc:0 "Democratic institutions like Congress are destabilising this country and should have their powers limited. The politicians in Congress and the bureaucracy have no interest in repairing the economics of America, merely exploiting our nation's wealth for their own personal gain. If they all are corporate puppets anyway, as people say, then the puppeteers are already in power."
 USA_congress_of_businessmen:0 "Congress of Businessmen"
 USA_congress_of_businessmen_desc:0 "Gone is the Congress of ignorant politicians. A Congress of elite businessmen and intelligent executives will bring prosperity to America. No longer will the bloodhounds of American politics decide policy, but rather cool and collected entrepreneurs and corporate elites, who truly understand the spirit and state of America."
 USA_economic_revival_act:0 "Economic Revival Act"
 USA_economic_revival_act_desc:0 "The Economic Revival Act, proposed by several executives from Eastern Texas, will supposedly boost revenue significantly. In addition, perhaps the executives who fled during the Bush and Rumsfeld era will finally realize that America is back, and here to stay."
 USA_return_of_the_americans:0 "Return of the Americans"
 USA_return_of_the_americans_desc:0 "With news of a truly corporate America under the leadership of President David Duke reaching Canada and most of the international scene, it appears numerous executives are returning to America, so that they can finally return to their decaying businesses and heal our economy. We welcome their guidance!"
 USA_create_investment_advisory_council:0 "Create Investment Advisory Council"
 USA_create_investment_advisory_council_desc:0 "Businessmen must be advising our government's policy on industry and the economy at every turn. Skilled stock-brokers and leaders of powerful corporations will be the first members of a new IAC that will ensure our investments are sound, secure and above all, benefit American jobs."
 USA_promote_skilled_immigration:0 "Promote Skilled Immigration"
 USA_promote_skilled_immigration_desc:0 "National Renewal has traditionally attacked the idea of immigration, declaring that it would lead to large-scale demographic change and corrupt America's white majority population. Our businessmen disagree. A compromise will be reached, as corporate America seeks for skilled labour across the country, all the while maintaining many of Duke's personal prejudices on such issues."
 USA_remove_corporate_taxes:0 "Remove Corporate Taxes"
 USA_remove_corporate_taxes_desc:0 "Taxes on corporations destroy the ability for small businesses to spring up and challenge the mainstream, along with destroying even large corporations who require deregulation and opportunity to truly pursue innovation. Fortunately, these troublesome taxes will soon be abolished, so that corporate America can truly breathe."
 USA_target_the_independence_union:0 "Target the Independence Union"
 USA_target_the_independence_union_desc:0 "The Independence Union has aimed to limit the power of corporations in America ever since the Republican Party embraced hard right-wing economics, believing that low taxes and opportunity were core values of the conservative movement. They may be, but the Independence Union are also traitors who would despise any democracy of the businessmen, and therefore must be removed."
 USA_crush_personal_liberties:0 "Crush Personal Liberties"
 USA_crush_personal_liberties_desc:0 "Personal liberties have no place in a corporate society. One has no need to vote, to speak out against the regime, and engage in other acts that could jeopardize our control over American society when they can much more easily be dutiful and quiet cogs in a greater machine. We can not have the common people of America attacking our rule, or else our regime would be truly illegitimate."
 USA_power_to_the_corporations:0 "Power to the Corporations"
 USA_power_to_the_corporations_desc:0 "President Duke has been a willing puppet, but unfortunately, he has generated our regime too much controversy and comparisons to open fascism and xenophobia. For the sake of our reputation and the efficiency of our government, he shall be removed, and full powers will be given to the Congress of Corporations instead, which will now truly guide America."
 USA_power_to_the_president:0 "Power to the President"
 USA_power_to_the_president_desc:0 "President Duke must maintain his power so that he can protect against the abuses of the Congress of Corporations. Although many in his party have abandoned him due to his shift toward corporatocracy, the National Renewal Party and the presidency must remain the supreme bodies of American life, not any corrupt legislature."
 USA_ensure_protection:0 "Ensure Protection"
 USA_ensure_protection_desc:0 "Under the Free State of America, the common citizen is always protected from the interests of big government and socialism that now control the former United States of America. Our army shall crush any threats that would dare threaten the ability of every American to achieve a seat in the Congress of Corporations with opportunity and ingenuity!"
 USA_it_cant_happen_here:0 "It Can't Happen Here"
 USA_it_cant_happen_here_desc:0 "A fascist government must come to America. With corporate control and interventionist politics corrupting the Republican Party from within, and the Independence Union and Democrats latching onto the weakness of liberal democracy, it is clear President Duke is the only man to restore authority and faith to the American Republic."
 USA_promote_traditional_american_values:0 "Promote Traditional American Values"
 USA_promote_traditional_american_values_desc:0 "No party in this nation truly has an interest in keeping traditional values intact. The Republicans are 10 years behind the Independence Union on social issues, who are 10 years behind the Democrats, but all in all, none are brave enough to truly oppose the relentless attacks on morality and tradition that have been pushed by corporate elites and liberal activists."
 USA_create_paramilitary:0 "Create Paramilitary"
 USA_create_paramilitary_desc:0 "A national army can protect our borders, but they cannot protect the lives of our citizens from internal threats. A paramilitary loyal to Duke and the National Renewal Party only must be created, so that any who threaten the President and his policies can be dealt with accordingly."
 USA_strengthen_the_national_army:0 "Strengthen the National Army"
 USA_strengthen_the_national_army_desc:0 "The army of the American Republic must be strengthened and protected so that it can remain loyal to the American ideal and the President's vision. With anarchists and communists preparing for war on the border of Virginia, our army must be powerful enough to stop them in their tracks."
 USA_rigged_congressional_election:0 "Rigged Congressional Elections"
 USA_rigged_congressional_election_desc:0 "New, rigged congressional elections across the nation will show the people that the National Renewal Party is here to stay and that the presidency of David Duke was not mere chance. With significant opposition remaining in Congress and the courts, even with our election victory, such elections are crucial for our party to win."
 USA_promote_research:0 "Promote Research"
 USA_promote_research_desc:0 "America has been lagging behind the world in military and electronic research methods for years since the Great Collapse. This must be changed, even if we have to hire more and more scientists loyal to our government and its causes to handle such a monumental new research and development initiative."
 USA_outlaw_dissent:0 "Outlaw Dissent"
 USA_outlaw_dissent_desc:0 "Even with our secret police, dissent from the remaining traitors in Congress and corporate organizations has only increased.

 USA_megalomaniac_construction:0 "Megalomaniac Construction"
 USA_megalomaniac_construction_desc:0 "The people of America have forgotten the beauty of our great country, its leaders, and its history.

 USA_links_to_the_kkk:0 "Links to the KKK"
 USA_links_to_the_kkk_desc:0 "The Ku Klux Klan has risen to national prominence once more with a new surge in far-right nationalism, racial politics, and Christian identity.

 USA_enforce_segregation_desc:0 "David Duke was too lenient on the issue of segregation, refusing to enforce it on a large-scale level.

 USA_inevitable_western_war:0 "Inevitable Western War"

 ETH_strengthen_our_military_desc:0 "Ethiopia’s military is not up to the standard it could be. The Revolutionary Armies that comprise the Ethiopian National Defense Force may be good compared to our neighbours but they still have much room for improvement.

 ETH_ensure_shengo_loyalty_desc:0 "The Shengo hasn't been cooperating with our administration for a few years now, as we have apparently failed to meet their demands regarding rural areas.

 ETH_land_operations:0 "Land Operations"
 ETH_land_operations_desc:0 "Conducting land warfare in this part of Africa is far from easy. Home to high mountains, scorching deserts and rough highlands, the terrain of this land is as diverse as it is unforgiving to those unprepared for it.

 ETH_prestigious_generals:0 "Prestigious Generals"
 ETH_prestigious_generals_desc:0 "One of the unfortunate legacies of the old Derg period is the massive amount of corruption that plagues our armed forces' leadership.

 ETH_agazi_commandos_desc:0 "Recruited almost exclusively from the mountainous Tigray region in northern Ethiopia, the feared Agazi Special Forces unit have traditionally received much training and support from our old friends in the Kremlin.

 ETH_air_operations:0 "Air Operations"
 ETH_air_operations_desc:0 "It was air superiority that allowed Italy to subdue us many decades ago. Our nation changed much since Mussolini's time and we now have an air force of our own.

 ETH_vessels_desc:0 "Almost all of the Ethiopian navy's tonnage dates back to before the year 2000 and none of its vessels were actually constructed in Ethiopia. The government has commissioned our nation's best logistical minds to draw up a plan that will overhaul our ageing navy."

 ETH_patrolling_the_waters_desc:0 "Our navy's ability to project power has historically been limited to the Red Sea and the area around the Horn of Africa where our foes have often just been feeble pirates from Somalia.

 ETH_world_class_navy:0 "World Class Navy"
 ETH_world_class_navy_desc:0 "Africa is not exactly famous for being home to great naval powers.

 ETH_soldiers:0 "Soldiers"
 ETH_soldiers_desc:0 "Ethiopia's warrior culture dates back millennia but the spirit still lives on in her soldiers today.

 ETH_new_weaponry:0 "New Weaponry"
 ETH_new_weaponry_desc:0 "The components of our soldiers' field kits have not changed very much since the 1970s. We should approach the manufacturers of more modern small arms and field equipment to supply the Ethiopian Army with lest our personnel remain frozen in the Cold War era."

New vehicles for the army's motor pool are in order."
 ETH_aircraft:0 "Aircraft"
 ETH_aircraft_desc:0 "Even if we had the best pilots, the best airfields, and the best air commanders, they would all be useless if our aircraft weren't also up to the same standards. We must invest in updating our air fleet, so that we can dominate the skies over Africa. Fighters, bombers, drones, we should invest in all that we can."
 ETH_self_sufficiency:0 "Self Sufficiency"
 ETH_self_sufficiency_desc:0 "The late revolutionary hero Thomas Sankara once said that 'He who feeds you controls you.'

 ETH_workers_army:0 "Workers' Army"
 ETH_workers_army_desc:0 "An armed forces dominated by corrupt, cliquish institutions like the Derg is incompatible with a truly socialist society.

 ENG_bolster_our_nuclear_arsenal:0 "Bolster our Nuclear Arsenal"
 ENG_bolster_our_nuclear_arsenal_desc:0 "The original party us Social Democrats split from advocated for nuclear disarmament.

 ENG_labour_welfare_program:0 "Labour Welfare Program"

 ENG_royal_guidance:0 "Royal Guidance"
 ENG_royal_guidance_desc:0 "We need the royal family to be our allies. Having been the cornerstone of British society for centuries, their support is needed to legitimize our regime. After all, since old King Edward VIII was sympathetic to the cause, surely his niece must be as well."
 ENG_out_with_royalty:0 "Out With Royalty"
 ENG_out_with_royalty_desc:0 "Windsors will only get in our way. With the Queen's failed power grab in mind, and her son's rabid tree-hugging tendencies, we cannot trust them to be loyal to our regime. It's time for an end to the monarchy as we know it."

 ENG_new_training_exercises:0 "New Training Exercises"
 ENG_new_training_exercises_desc:0 "From the UK to Ireland and Ireland to Ulster, all soldiers will be trained by those with the highest qualifications. This will also help tying the Protection Union much closer together and bridge the gaps between Briton and Irishman!"

 ENG_invite_iran_desc:0 "While Iran and Britain have had a sordid history, fifty years have passed since the last bump on the road. Hopefully, the time passed has made the Iranians forgive us, so that they would be willing to join in our alliance and be a strong bastion in the Middle East."
 ENG_irish_trade:0 "Irish Trade"

 ENG_trade_with_west_africa_desc:0 "West Africa is a developing country, and thus yearning for capital with which to modernize and develop.

 ENG_defend_the_skies:0 "Defend the Skies"
 ENG_defend_the_skies_desc:0 "The 20th century proved that there's a third dimension to warfare: The airspace. Today, even the mightiest armies and navies can be destroyed by air power. If we are to protect Britain from foreign threats, we must remember that we shall rule the third dimension too."

 ENG_the_queens_soldiers:0 "The Queen's Soldiers"
 ENG_the_queens_soldiers_desc:0 "While Her Majesty technically is the Commander-in-Chief of the army, archaic legislation still prevents Her Majesty from utilizing her army without the assent of Parliament.

 ENG_federation_desc:0 "While the Scottish and Welsh hold legitimate grievances towards the British state, to merely cut them loose and tell them to go their own way would be an uncomradely decision.

 GAU_unprecedented_stability:0 "Unprecedented Stability"
 GAU_unprecedented_stability_desc:0 "Calm transfer of power from Bernie Sanders to a member of his own faction has paved the way for unprecedented political stability. After the peaceful transition of power between the late Sanders and his protege Mackler, the way has been paved for stability in America that it has not known since the presidential election of 1956. Mackler is expected to adhere to National Bolshevism as we know it, so there will not be any political surprises."

 GAU_restore_trade_unions:0 "Restore Trade Unions"

Under Sanders, America has become the great nation it was before, but we need to abandon his isolationist principles to truly match up to anyone threatening our interests once again!"
 GAU_communists:0 "Communists"
 GAU_communists_desc:0 "With a mutual hatred of the socialists that came to power in 1988, Sanders and the Communist Party forged an unlikely alliance, and were permitted as a faction within the Socialist Party since. The Commonwealth’s Communist Party formed an unlikely alliance with the Socialist Party based on mutual hatred of Philadelphia’s corruption and have been tolerated as a faction in the party ever since. To the shock of the nation, this ‘’Muscovite’’ faction has come out on top, most likely because of foreign interference. Only one thing is for certain, and that is that the Union will never be the same. These Communists effectively presented themselves as the rightful rulers of this Union."
 GAU_erode_the_cult_of_personality:0 "Erode the Cult of Personality"
 GAU_erode_the_cult_of_personality_desc:0 "A continuing cult of personality surrounding Sam Webb's predecessor will severely damage our ability to govern.

 GAU_true_socialist_economics:0 "True Socialist Economics"
 GAU_true_socialist_economics_desc:0 "The 'bolshevik' economy of Sanders was not true socialism. Sanders’ so-called ‘’National Bolshevism’’ is nothing like Lenin and the original Bolsheviks intended. We shall reform the economic system so it will finally resemble true socialism."
 GAU_adopt_internationalism:0 "Adopt Internationalism"
