 decision_event.1.d:0 "Senator John F. Kennedy of Massachusetts was assassinated on Wednesday, March 16, 1955 at 11:42am in Albany, New York just minutes after meeting Governor William Harriman. Kennedy was in secret talks with the Governor of New York concerning possible cabinet membership in the event of the former's victory in an upcoming presidential election. Walking out of the State Capitol in the arms of wife Jacqueline, young Senator Kennedy was fatally shot by lone gunman David Ferrie. The presidential hopeful was pronounced dead at Albany Medical Center approximately twenty-five minutes after the terrifying shooting. While conspiracies have circulated wildly since that day, the generally accepted consensus is that Kennedy's numerous calls for peace in Cuba no matter the cost agitated Ferrie's strong anti-Communist sentiments. It is also believed that the pilot assumed Kennedy was preparing for a Presidential bid in 1956, and assassinating him early was the only way to stop a 'Marxist-sympathiser' from occupying the White House. His death is seen by some as a turning point in American political history, unbeknownst to those at the time, as Kennedy's immense popularity indicated that in a presidential race he would win a landslide. Hence the political troubles plaguing upcoming elections could have been avoided."

 decision_event.2.d:0 "The United States presidential election of 1952 was the 42nd quadrennial presidential election, held on Tuesday, November 4, 1952. Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower won a landslide victory over Democrat Adlai Stevenson, ending a string of Democratic Party wins that stretched back to 1932. Incumbent Democratic President Harry S. Truman had initially sought a second full term, but the unpopular incumbent withdrew from the race following North Korea's devastating victory in the Korean War. After Truman's withdrawal, the president and other party leaders rallied around Stevenson, the moderate Governor of Illinois. Stevenson emerged victorious on the third presidential ballot of the 1952 Democratic National Convention, defeating Kefauver, Senator Richard Russell Jr. of Georgia, and other candidates. The Republican nomination was primarily contested by conservative Governor Robert A. Taft of Ohio and Eisenhower, a general who was widely popular for his leadership in World War II. With the support of Thomas E. Dewey and other party leaders, Eisenhower narrowly prevailed over Taft at the 1952 Republican National Convention. The Republicans chose Richard Nixon, a young anti-Communist Senator from California, as Eisenhower's running mate. Eisenhower retained his enormous popularity from the war, as seen in his campaign slogan, "I Like Ike." Eisenhower's popularity and Truman's unpopularity led to a Republican victory, and Eisenhower won 55% of the popular vote. He carried every state outside of the South and won several Southern states that had almost always voted for Democrats since the end of Reconstruction. Republicans also won control of both houses of Congress."

 decision_event.3.d:0 "The Korean Peace Agreement, known commonly around the world as the 'surrender at Okpo-dong' was the unconditional surrender of American forces on the Korean peninsula on July 5, 1952. In the weeks proceeding, a small remaining number of troops was isolated within the South-Eastern tip of Korea, notably after the fall of Busan to Communist forces. On Geoje Island, General Mark Clark desperately awaited evacuation, but as time passed realised that the government had abandoned all hope of bringing them back safely. On the fourth of July Clark's troops surrendered to encircling KPA units, and the following day signed an agreement that formally terminated all American military presence in Korea, although it was already technically illegal internationally. The surrender at Okpo-dong was not just a victory in conflict for North Korea, but also a major propaganda success, with the image of shattered US soldiers being spread far and wide across the world. For the first time in recent memory, America had lost."

 decision_event.4.d:0 "The 1953 Iranian coup d'etat was the overthrow of the democratically elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh in favour of strengthening the monarchical rule of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi on 19 August 1953, orchestrated by the United Kingdom and the United States. Mossadegh had sought to audit the documents of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, a British corporation nd to limit the company's control over Iranian petroleum reserves. Upon the refusal of the AIOC to co-operate with the Iranian government, the parliament voted to nationalize Iran's oil industry and to expel foreign corporate representatives from the country. After this vote, Britain instigated a worldwide boycott of Iranian oil to pressure Iran economically. Initially, Britain mobilized its military to seize control of the British-built Abadan oil refinery, then the world's largest, but Prime Minister Clement Attlee opted instead to tighten the economic boycott while using Iranian agents to undermine Mosaddegh's government. Winston Churchill and the Eisenhower administration decided to overthrow Iran's government, though the predecessor Truman administration had opposed a coup, fearing the precedent that CIA involvement would set. Following the coup in 1953, a government under General Fazlollah Zahedi was formed which allowed Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the last Shah of Iran, to rule more firmly as monarch."

 decision_event.5.d:0 "The 1954 Guatemalan coup d'etat was a covert operation carried out by the Central Intelligence Agency that deposed the democratically elected Guatemalan President Jacobo Arbenz and ended the Guatemalan Revolution. Code-named Operation PBSUCCESS, it installed the military dictatorship of Carlos Castillo Armas, the first in a series of U.S.-backed authoritarian rulers in Guatemala. Eisenhower was elected U.S. President in 1952, promising to take a harder line against communism. Additionally, the U.S. government drew exaggerated conclusions about the extent of communist influence from the presence of a small number of communists among Arbenz's advisers. Eisenhower authorized the CIA to carry out Operation PBSUCCESS in August 1953. The CIA armed, funded, and trained a force of 480 men led by Carlos Castillo Armas. The coup was preceded by U.S. efforts to criticize and isolate Guatemala internationally. Castillo Armas' force invaded Guatemala on 18 June 1954, backed by a heavy campaign of psychological warfare. This included a radio station which broadcast anti-government propaganda and a version of military events favorable to the rebellion, claiming to be genuine news, as well as bombings of Guatemala City and a naval blockade of Guatemala. The invasion force fared poorly militarily, and most of its offensives were defeated. However, psychological warfare and the possibility of a U.S. invasion intimidated the Guatemalan army, which eventually refused to fight. Arbenz briefly and unsuccessfully attempted to arm civilians to resist the invasion, before resigning on 27 June. Castillo Armas became president ten days later, following negotiations in San Salvador. Described as the definitive deathblow to democracy in Guatemala, the coup was widely criticized internationally, and contributed to long-lasting anti-U.S. sentiment in Latin America."

 decision_event.6.d:0 "The United States presidential election of 1956 was the 43rd quadrennial presidential election, held on Tuesday, November 6, 1956. The divisive incumbent President, Republican Dwight Eisenhowever successfully ran for re-election. Eisenhowever, who had first become famous for his military leadership in World War II, had become far more divisive than expected due to his tough stance on Communism appearing to fail. Nevertheless, he was unopposed at the Republican National Convention and faced a broad national following similar to but not quite to the extent of his first election campaign. Governor William Harriman defeated 1952 nominee Adlai Stevenson and other candidates to seize the Democratic Party's nomination, calling for a 'New Wave' against well-established social policies. In the end, Harriman's attempt at creating a populist movement while clearly being a member of the elite establishment doomed the Democratic Party in 1956, handing a second term to President Eisenhower on election night. The incumbent lost support with Republicans but surprisingly made significant gains among Democrats, especially white urban Southerners and Northern Catholics. This would be the last presidential election where a candidate won outright until 1972."

 decision_event.7.t:0 "Civil Rights Movement"
 decision_event.7.d:0 "The civil rights movement was a decades-long movement with the goal of securing legal rights for African Americans that other Americans already held. Encompassing strategies, various groups, and organized social movements to accomplish the goals of ending legalized racial segregation and discrimination in the United States, the movement, using major nonviolent campaigns, eventually secured new recognition in federal law and federal protection of all Americans. Moderates in the movement worked with Congress to achieve the passage of several significant pieces of federal legislation overturning discriminatory practices. President Rhodes' Civil Rights Act of 1966 expressly banned discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin in employment practices; ended unequal application of voter registration requirements; and prohibited racial segregation in schools, at the workplace, and in public accommodations. Successive legislation rapidly ended legal inequality in the United States, most notably during the Rhodes Presidency and his successor Lyndon Johnson's first year. From 1962 through 1971, a wave of inner-city riots in black communities undercut support from the white middle class, but increased support from private foundations. The emergence of the Black Power movement, which lasted from about 1963 to 1982, challenged the established black leadership for its cooperative attitude and its practice of nonviolence, and instead demanding that, in addition to the new laws gained through the nonviolent movement, political and economic self-sufficiency be built in the black community. Charismatic universally recognised leader of the civil rights movement Martin Luther King played a significant role in inspiring millions around the nation, and his assassination attempt is seen as the final blow against pro-segregation movements."

 decision_event.8.d:0 "The United States presidential election of 1960 was the 44th quadrennial presidential election, held on Tuesday, November 8, 1960. In a closely contested election, Republican Vice President Richard Nixon defeated Democrat George Smathers. This was the first election in which all fifty states participated, the first in which an incumbent president was ineligible to run for another term, and the first since 1876 where the winner was decided by the House. Nixon faced little opposition in the Republican race to succeed popular incumbent Dwight D. Eisenhower. Smathers, a Florida senator on the other hand battled against a range of adversaries. Most notably Lyndon B. Johnson, who after losing the nomination to Smathers, formed his own 'Independent Democrats' party to contest the November election. The issue of the Cold War dominated the election, as tensions were high between the United States and the Soviet Union. Nixon only just seized the highest number of electoral college votes, six higher than Democratic nominee Smathers and far above rebel Johnson's forty-nine. Due to no candidate reaching the 269 threshold, Congress was called upon to elect the 35th President of the United States. Having won in both houses since the early 1950s, the Republican Party controversially approved Vice President Nixon's rise to the highest office in the land. For a brief period of extremely unusual political intricacies, Nixon's running mate Jim Rhodes became President as a caretaker head of state, later rising to the call again after the President's assassination on election night 1964."

 decision_event.9.d:0 "The Cuban Missile Crisis was a 22-day confrontation between the United States and Soviet Union concerning American ballistic missile deployment in Italy and Turkey with consequent Soviet ballistic missile deployment in Cuba. In response to a failed counterrevolutionary coup in Havana, sponsored by the United States and Haiti, Soviet leader Malenkov decided to agree to Cuba's request to place nuclear missiles on the island to deter a future invasion. An agreement was reached during telephone calls between Malenkov and Fidel Castro in March 1961 and construction of a number of missile launch facilities started later that Summer. Secretary of State William Rogers managed to convince the initially cautious Richard Nixon to establish a military blockade in order to prevent missiles from reaching Cuba. Under Secretary of State and alleged mastermind behind the blockade Henry Kissinger announced to a White House press conference that the United States would not permit offensive weapons to be delivered to Cuba. Demands were subsequently made that the remaining missiles be dismantled and returned to the Soviet Union. After a long period of tense negotiations, Nixon fired Secretary Rogers for attempting to subvert the President's authority and organise another Haitian-backed coup in Cuba. Following the shocking expulsion, Nixon came to be seen as a Communist sympathiser in the last days of the Cuban Missile Crisis, finally conceding to Malenkov in a spectacular capitulation. On August 15, 1961, the United States agreed to withdraw all nuclear missiles from Turkey and Italy, and the Soviet Union was permitted to maintain half of its arsenal on the island of Cuba. The crisis remains a low point for US supremacy in the Cold War, giving Moscow an edge that would last for at least another decade."

 decision_event.10.d:0 "Richard Nixon, the 35th President of the United States, was assassinated on November 3, 1964, at 3:48 p.m. in Los Angeles, California while walking to his suite at the Ambassador Hotel. The President, set on a political collision course with Democrat Lyndon Johnson and Independent Nelson Rockefeller that very night, was being heckled by another guest of the hotel when multiple shots were fired at the commander in chief from behind. Lee Harvey Oswald was the gunman who murdered Nixon on 1964's election night, supposedly for the sole purpose of destabilising his home nation in the short term. After Oswald was tackled to the ground by secret service agents, the President was immediately taken to a nearby hospital, but despite the work of Los Angeles' finest doctors died approximately fifty minutes later. Votes cast in Nixon's name at the ballot box were subsequently transferred to Vice President Jim Rhodes, who would go on to be elected President by Congress with the reluctant support of a battered Nelson Rockefeller. Alongside other dates in American history, the assassination of President Nixon is considered one of the most impactful and destabilising, as the widely accepted view is that after his presidency the state of national politics was forever in turmoil seemingly without opportunity to repair."
