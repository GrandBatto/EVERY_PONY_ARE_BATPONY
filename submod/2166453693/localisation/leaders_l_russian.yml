### Leader Descriptions ###
POLITICS_HYSNI_MILLOSHI_DESC:0 "After the untimely death of Albanian leader Ramiz Alia, the Party of Labour selected a successor from the younger pool of prominent figures. Eventually Hysni Milloshi was elected First Secretary and subsequently became the paramount leader of Albania. Since then he has ruled the small nation with an iron fist, relying on development aid from other Warsaw Pact nations and expanding Enver Hoxha's efforts to defend against the Yugoslavian threat."
POLITICS_LOUISA_HANOUNE_DESC:0 "A prominent figure within the Algerian radical socialist movement, Louisa Hanoune led numerous protests against the dictatorship that had ruled her country for decades, inspiring a nation to get behind her polarising views. While eventually the regime did come to an end, it took almost five years for Hanoune to become Workers' Party leader in 1990 and subsequently President in 1991. Since the 'Silent Revolution' as it is called in Algeria's contemporary history books, Hanoune has intertwined her party into every aspect of Algerian society, while ensuring not to establish a cult of personality around herself or any other prominent figures. Her unique revolutionary regime has inspired other movements around the world, and she remains the most powerful woman in Africa."
POLITICS_JOSE_EDUARDO_DOS_SANTOS_DESC:0 "Jose Eduardo dos Santos has served as President of Angola since the death of liberation fighter Agostinho Neto in 1979. Angola's war for independence against Portugal both inspired many in Africa, and even the home country itself, with Lisbon falling to revolutionary forces in the following years. Santos' regime has remained isolated from the world for countless decades, choosing to remain immune to 'petty international politics' that the omnipresent Soviet Union engages in. However, with his iron fist still remaining stronger than ever, the President is weakening in his resolve to keep on going, and a lack of desginated successor may prove to be the downfall of his seemingly unbeatable revolutionary party."
POLITICS_SERGIO_MASSA_DESC:0 "Sergio Massa was unknown to many in the country, until at the age of just 25 he led a revived democratic movement to bringing down a brutal socialist regime. Peronists at the time thought little of the man, but by the drafting of a new constitution in 1999, Massa had solidified his powerbase and gained powerful allies throughout the political sphere. In 2004, he won his first election to become President of Argentina, presenting himself as the savior of a new Argentina that was still lagging behind its neighbours in South America. Initially the economy improved and the people were content with their revolutionary leader remaining head of state for as long as possible, but a short-lived military coup in 2006 ended his leadership. The following year, the ruling junta collapsed due to a devastating economic crisis unfolding across the continent, leading to another restoration of true democracy. In the 2009 election, Massa won to enter his second non-consecutive term as President of Argentina."
POLITICS_HARRY_MITCHELL_DESC:0 "Harry Mitchell was Mayor of Tempe Arizona from 1978 until 1992, with a brief gap in 1988 during the Admiralty Incident. Using this as a springboard to propell his political career further, he sought the Social Renewal Party nomination in 1997, but failed to win any significant number of votes outside his home city. However, his luck would turn around in 2001 when the Social Renewal and Democratic Union parties merged to create the Social Union. Supporters of his 1997 campaign turned out in huge numbers to convince the rest of the country that this time Mitchell could unite them all. At the time, Arizona was a deeply divided nation shattered by corruption revelations and emigrants fleeing from every direction. By mid 2001, Mitchell had secured the nomination, and in November he became President of Arizona. Since inauguration in 2002 his programs of moderate welfare expansion, an enormous infrastructure endeavour and an unprecedented fight against corruption, have led to victories for the Social Union at every single national election. Whilst there are no term limits in Arizona, Mitchell seems ready to retire in time for the 2013 election, and his successor may not be so popular."
POLITICS_JULIA_GILLARD_DESC:0 "Julia Gillard has been a controversial figure in Australian politics for years, consistently using outlandish statements on the campaign trail to garner unprecedented support within disillusioned voters. Formerly a member of the defunct People's Alternative, a revolutionary socialist party, Gillard has shifted further to the right in the past thirty years, joining Labor in 1989. She was first elected to the House of Representatives in 1998, becoming Shadow Agriculture Minister in 2001. By the time of the Liberal National Coalition's collapse in 2004, she had risen to the position of Deputy Leader, and upon Labor's landslide loss to the rapidly growing Australian Conservatives in 2007, she was selected to succeed her mentor John Brumby as party leader. In a snap 2009 election, Gillard claimed an unprecedented victory, being elected Prime Minister with an overwhelming majority of seats. However, in recent months her popularity has plunged due to a worsening economic crisis and a growing rift with the Governor General. Australia's first female Prime Minister will have to battle against all odds to maintain her position until the next federal election."
POLITICS_PETER_MERTENS_DESC:0 "As a teenager in the economically shattered Belgium, Peter Mertens became an adherent of radical Marxist-Leninist thought. By the landslide national victory for Belgium's Workers' Party in 1984, Mertens had already joined the Marxistich-Leninistische Beweging, a growing force in local politics. Initially sceptical of the Workers' Party in power, he came to join their ranks after the attempted 'reactionary coup' in 1986, when he was just 17. Upon Germany's reunification and rapid Warsaw Pact expansion throughout Western Europe, Mertens sought closer alliances with those above him. Eventually in the late 1990s, he was granted his wish after gradually climbing through the ranks. Becoming Junior Politburo Member in 1997, Mertens had achieved national recognition and was slated by some as the possibly youthful successor to Secretary Ludo Martens. However, it would take another decade for Peter to lead his nation. After revolutionary Ludo's death in 2008, allies of the current Secretary moved quick to secure his place as the natural successor, purging possible opposition and rounding up all Politburo members who refused to comply with the new policies already put forward within the State Assembly. On Christmas Day, Peter Mertens became First Secretary and President of Belgium."
POLITICS_JIGME_SINGYE_WANGCHUCK_DESC:0 "Dragon King Jigme Singye Wangchuck received his education in Western institutions, from India to England. Upon his father's death, he became Dragon King in 1972, vowing to the dying head of state in earlier weeks that he would continue his legacy of democratisation and opening up of Bhutan. In the following decades, this is exactly what he did. By establishing various checks and balances and the first stages of a constitutional government, the King ushered in a new era of love between the royal family and its subjects. Since those first years the people of Bhutan have grown to not just revere, but adore their head of state, proud of the many accomplishments he has made, especially in recent years when the national gross domestic product was shown to have increased at an astonishing rate just since the early 2000s. However, at the turn of this decade there are rumours throughout Bhutan that the Dragon King is preparing to abdicate in favour of his eldest son. But an end to their beloved monarch could stoke the flames of great political change."
POLITICS_OSCAR_ZAMORA_MEDINACELI_DESC:0 "Originally a member of the Bolivian Communist Party and even founder of the Communist Youth organisation, Oscar Zamora Medinaceli split from the party in 1964. His growing connections with Chinese officials and devoted Maoists had angered many within the highest levels of party administration, and his expulsion was met by an outcry from fellow Bolivian Maoists. In 1965 he formed the Socialist Party, which eventually became the Revolutionary Left Front after another catastrophic split. However, despite the worsening situation for far left politics in Bolivia, the tide was about to turn. The recently formed socialist governments of Argentina, Peru, Paraguay and Uruguay invaded Bolivia to topple the right wing dictatorship of Rene Barrientos. Their operation was successful, and Medinaceli was appointed by the occupying forces as Bolivian President. Just three years later in 1970, Argentina, Bolivia and Peru would mount another successful offensive against Pinochet's regime in Chile. Since then, President Medinaceli has ruled with an iron fist over Bolivia, demanding total allegiance from both the military and populace. However, after revolutions toppled socialist governments in Argentina, Peru and Uruguay, the situation is growing dire every year, and Bolivia could be the next to go."
POLITICS_ROMERO_JUCA_DESC:0 "President Romero Juca was once an unknown politician in the state of Roraimo, as both socialist governments and right wing dictatorships ruled Brazil for countless decades. However, when the Democratic Movement toppled the last military junta in 1987, Juca quickly rose to the top of the state's food chain, being elected Governor in 1989. His career there would not last long, being ousted by his leftist opponents in 1983. On the other hand, his failure in his home state proved to be the greatest opportunity of Juca's life, being called to the capital for a personal meeting with Itamar Franco. This exchange solidified his growing powerbase within national politics, as prominent figures grew to like his populist tone and the fiery debates he had conducted in Roraima. By 2006 he was elected leader of the Democratic Movement, and in 2007 won his first nationwide election to became the President of Brazil. Ending more than a decade of leftist national government, Juca is seen as the savior of centrist politics, but has gradually leaned to the left in recent years to appease disgruntled voters across Brazil."
POLITICS_ALEKSANDER_PAUNOV_DESC:0 "Aleksander Paunov was a member of the Bulgarian Communist Party's academic faction before his rise to power. As a junior member of the State Council, he frequently conflicted with the opinions of fellow members, but always ensured total loyalty to General Secretary Todor Zhivkov. When longtime leader Zhivkov died in 1998, his close friend Petar Mladenov succeeded him in the renamed office of People's Secretary, but would himself fall to illness in late 1999 and die. At this point the Communist Party old guard were struggling to maintain control, and the threat of a popular uprising against their stagnating government was all too real for most. Eventually, they decided the younger 50-year old Aleksander Paunov, now Deputy Advisor to Bulgaria's State Council, should become their paramount leader for the coming millennium. After being sworn in on the 1st of January 2000, Paunov orchestrated a devastating purge throughout the country. In just one year, his ruthlessness became the face of the Warsaw Pact, strengthening the resolve of other allied leaders and showing to Europe's disgruntled populace that their disobedience would be met with the harshest consequences. By 2003, Paunov secured total control over Bulgaria and the last remnants of the old guard were wiped out. Seen by many as the most tyrannical leader in the Warsaw Pact, Aleksander Paunov is certainly one to be feared, and shows no signs of retiring from his office any time soon."
POLITICS_BOKASSA_II_DESC:0 "Born as Jean-Serge Bokassa, the current Emperor of Central Africa became a Prince with the style Imperial Highness in 1976. After avoiding a possibly disasterous military coup in 1979, the head of state grew increasingly paranoid and weary of his closest advisors and even family members. By the late 1980s he had sidelined many within the Imperial Court, and ensured a clear line of succession within the family so no one would dare to remove him from power. Nevertheless, when he attempted to commit suicide in 1994 via drug overdose, his younger son but designated heir apparent Jean-Bedel Bokassa Jr. attempted to seize control. The suicide attempt failed and Emperor Bokassa was furious that his son would disobey his wishes, subsequently executing his heir and all those who declared loyalty to him during the 'coup'. After this incident, the Emperor chose a son and cabinet minister he formerly called 'weak', Jean-Serge Bokassa to succeed him as head of state. The new Crown Prince diligently waited for his father to die, and eventually he did in a plane crash above Sudan, just hours before New Years Day 1996. For 14 years, Bokassa II has reigned over the Empire, making numerous efforts to reform and democratise many aspects of the nation. However, while the economy is being decentralised and ministerial posts are being given more powers, the House of Bokassa still remains the sole legal and 'holy' leadership of Central Africa."
POLITICS_PRESTON_MANNING_DESC:0 "Preston Manning founded and led the Reform Party of Canada to many victories in both provincial and federal elections from 1987 to 1998. However, the stabilisation period after America's demise and NATO's collapse, led to mainstream parties experiencing an enormous resurgence. After a devastating loss at the 2000 election, Manning resigned as party leader, and subsequently dissolved Reform. For many years he retired from politics to become simply a footnote in Canada's history, failing to gain enough seats to govern even at his party's height. However, when the Liberal Party became mired by the biggest corruption scandal in our history, Manning was inspired by his loyal followers to once again rejoin the political arena and take down the corrupt establishment figures. In 2006 the Progressive Conservatives lost to the New Democratic Party, and after joining the former in 2003 Manning was seen as a possible successor to the now resigned leadership. Less than a month after the election, PC members elected him as their next party leader, believing he could turn back the center-left tide and bring true populism back to the forefront of Canadian politics. In 2008, the party won by a landslide, with the Canadian people electing Preston Manning to become Prime Minister."
POLITICS_DANIEL_ORTEGA_DESC:0 "Initially 'Coordinator of the Junta of National Reconstruction', Daniel Ortega has led Nicaragua and subsequently Central America since 1975. After training with Cuban forces in guerilla warfare, the revolutionary returned to his home nation to fight against the Somoza presidential dynasty. By 1974 the tide had turned against the dictatorship, and Orteg'a forces seized complete control in late 1975. When the constitutional convention was cancelled, the international community expressed dismay, believing that the Sandinista Front would restore real democracy in Nicaragua. Despite their grievances, the socialist junta continued until a suitable civilian administration could be put in place. After fighting against a right wing rebellion in the mid-1980s, President Ortega finally made concessions and dissolved the Junta to officially become President. From this day forward he worked tirelessly to unite Central America under one government, leading resistance forces in neighbouring nations to victory against their respective right wing dictatorships. In 1997, the Socialist Republic of Central America was established with Ortega as its sole head of state, advocating for a centralised government rather than the federal alternatives of the past. Since then, no opposition against the President has gained any power, and the various rebels that remain across the country are weakening by the day. It seems Ortega will rule until he dies."
POLITICS_JOHN_CHIANG_DESC:0 "After the death of Chiang Kai-shek, his son Chiang Ching-kuo became President of the Chinese Republic, continuing his father's authoritarian rule. However, during his rule from 1975 to 1988 the government inevitably opened itself up to political dissident and the establishment of powerful opposition within the country. Freedom of speech was enshrined in various laws and demonstrations against government policy were once again permitted for the first time in decades. Upon his own death, the grandson of Chiang Kai-shek won a power struggle to succeed him. While the former President's deputy Lee Teng-hui was slated to become his successor, there were still many within the Republic that demanded a presidential bloodline to last for decades onwards. A driving force behind this movement was the military, which stood alongside the late President's son Chiang Hsiao-yen in his bloody coup against the short-lived bensheng ren administration. In just two days Acting President Lee Teng-hui was murdered as well as a significant portion of the Executive Yuan. Eventually, the illegitimate son came out on top as China's victorious ruler, consolidating his power over the following years. Since those turbulent times the island nation has come to hate their President, and his own advisors are drifting away."
POLITICS_ISABEL_ALLENDE_DESC:0 "In 1970, Salvador Allende was elected President of Chile, adopting a policy of nationalisation and collectivisation. His national leadership however was short-lived, when a military coup led by Augusto Pinochet removed him from office and exiled his family to Mexico. Advised by the Soviet Union and other socialist parties in the Americas, the radical left regimes of Argentina, Bolivia and Peru successfully invaded Pinochet's Chile and executed him upon the surrender of his capital forces. Only a month after the initial military coup, Allende's family had returned to the country, with former First Lady Hortensia Bussi appointed head of state by the occupying powers. She would remain leader of the Socialist Party for fourteen years, gradually reconstructing the country and restoring the people's faith in their government. When she was assassinated in 1987, Chile was breifly governed by four different Presidents over the space of just three years. The chaos resulting from this party instability led to a military intervention. Once the dust had settled and allies of the former President had been arrested, the daughter of Salvador, Isabel Allende was elected President by the recently convened Emergency National Assembly. Since 1990, she has ruled Chile democratically, winning every election since, but many in the international community have begun to question the legitimacy of many of these electoral results."
POLITICS_HENG_SAMRIN_DESC:0 "Heng Samrin became Chairman of the Revolutionary Council in 1979, after a Vietnamese invasion of the infamous Democratic Kampuchea, controlled by the Khmer Rouge. In 1981 his powers were increased, ascending to the office of General Secretary. Since the final years of the Vietnamese occupation, Kampuchea has been entirely independent from its neighbouring communist nation, and Samrin has led an effort to ensure that no other nations attempt to interfere in internal politics again. An attempted assassination of the General Secretary in 2007 left him badly injured, but he appears to have recovered since then. However, many within the Salvation Front are worried that their revolutionary leader is growing tired of the job and may not be in the best shape to run a country."
POLITICS_JUAN_MANUEL_SANTOS_DESC:0 "Juan Manuel Santos has been an influential politician in Colombia for decades, holding key positions within various governments. A member of the wealthy Santos family, which is alleged to illegally run almost all of Colombia's major media sectors, Juan Manuel worked his way up the ladder during the 1990s. His ability to create 'impossible deals' endeared him to many in the Colombian political sphere, but also made him a lot of enemies. By 2002, President Alvaro Uribe appointed him Vice President, hoping for the older man to succeed him in later years. However, in 2006 their relationship had soured and Santos secretly leaked incriminating evidence against his former friend and the head of state. The President however refused to accept fault, resulting in a stunning move from the Vice President. In 2007 he resigned from his post and formed a new party, taking three quarters of the leader's party with him. With the Congress of Colombia now firmly against President Uribe, he was impeached in a historic vote, and a snap election was held to decide a successor to Acting President Roy Barreras. The people subsequently voted overwhelmingly for Santos, who became President not long after. Since then he has remained a controversial figure in Colombian politics, from his betrayal of a former ally and close friend, to the deep connections his family has with money and media."
